This repository contains the tasks completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Throughout the internship, I worked on three exciting web development projects: a calculator, a tribute page, and a to-do list application. Each project showcases different aspects of web development and allowed me to explore various technologies and concepts.

Calculator: The calculator project demonstrates my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a fully functional calculator with arithmetic operations, clear functionality, and a visually appealing user interface. The code is organized and well-commented, making it easy to understand and maintain.

Tribute Page: The tribute page project showcases my skills in creating static web pages. I selected a notable individual and designed a visually appealing tribute page to honor Elon Musk. The page includes relevant information and captivating visuals, with a focus on responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.

To-Do List: The to-do list application highlights my ability to develop dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. It incorporates features like adding tasks, marking them as complete, and deleting tasks, providing a seamless user experience.

By sharing these projects in this repository, I aim to demonstrate my growth as a web developer during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The code is well-documented and structured, making it easy for others to understand and potentially build upon. Feel free to explore the tasks and provide feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting the Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks repository. I hope you find inspiration and insights from my web development journey.
